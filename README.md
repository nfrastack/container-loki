## About

This will build a Docker Image [loki::NG](https://loki-ng.org/) an elegant web based manager for Authentication (SAML, OpenID Connect, CAS) served by Nginx.

* Sane defaults to have a working solution by just running the image
* Automatically generates configuration files on startup, or option to use your own
* Option to just use image as a Handler for external servers
* Handler Option to use file base socket or listen on TCP
* Fail2ban Included for blocking brute force attacks.
* Ready to work out the box for SAML, OpenID, 2FA/2OTP
* Additional modules compiled for Redis, Mysql, Postgres, LDAP Session/Config Storage
* Choice of Logging (Console, File, Syslog)

*This is an incredibly complex piece of software and this image tries to get you up and running with sane defaults, you will need to switch eventually over to manually configuring the configuration file when depending on your usage case*

## Prerequisites and Assumptions
*  Assumes you are using some sort of SSL terminating reverse proxy such as:
   *  [Traefik](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-traefik)
   *  [Nginx](https://github.com/jc21/nginx-proxy-manager)
   *  [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)
* You must have access to create records on your DNS server to be able to setup the demo installation before configuration.


## Installation

### Build from Source
Clone this repository and build the image with `docker build -t (imagename) .`

### Prebuilt Images
Builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/loki) and is the recommended method of installation.

```bash
docker pull tiredofit/loki:(imagetag)
```

The following image tags are available along with their tagged release based on what's written in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md):

| Version | Container OS | Tag          |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| latest  | Alpine       | `:latest`    |
| 2.0.x   | Alpine       | `2.0-latest` |


## Configuration

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.
* If you'd like to just use it in Handler mode, you will find another sample docker-compose.yml file that should get you started.
* Add records for your main, and manager names into DNS (ie `handler.sso.example.com`. `api.manager.sso.example.com`, `manager.sso.example.com`, `sso.example.com`, `test.sso.example.com`)
* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image. A Sample `docker-compose.yml` is provided that will work right out of the box for most people without any fancy optimizations.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.
* Once run, visit the Manager URL and login as `dwho/dwho`

### Persistent Storage

The following directories should be mapped for persistent storage in order to utilize the container effectively.

| Folder                            | Description                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/etc/loki-ng/`              | (Optional) - loki core configuration files. Auto Generates on Container startup |
| `/var/lib/loki-ng/conf`      | Actual Configuration of loki (lmConf-X.js files)                                |
| `/var/lib/loki-ng/sessions`  | (Optional) - Storage of Sessions of users                                            |
| `/var/lib/loki-ng/psessions` | (Optional) - Storage of Sessions of users                                            |
| `/assets/custom`                  | Ability to overwrite themes/inject into image upon bootup for theming /etc.          |
| `/www/logs`                       | Log files for individual services                                                    |

### Environment Variables

#### Base Images used

This image relies on an [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/alpine) base image that relies on an [init system](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for added capabilities. Outgoing SMTP capabilities are handlded via `msmtp`. Individual container performance monitoring is performed by [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org). Additional tools include: `bash`,`curl`,`less`,`logrotate`, `nano`,`vim`.

Be sure to view the following repositories to understand all the customizable options:

| Image                                                  | Description                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| [OS Base](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-alpine/) | Customized Image based on Alpine Linux |
| [Nginx](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-nginx/)    | Nginx webserver                        |


There are a huge amount of configuration variables and it is recommended that you get comfortable for a few hours with the [loki::NG Documentation](https://loki-ng.org/documentation/2.0/start)

You will eventually based on your usage case switch over to `SETUP_TYPE=MANUAL` and edit your own `loki-ng.ini`. While I've tried to make this as easy to use as possible, once in production you'll find much better success with large implementations with this approach.

By Default this image is ready to run out of the box, without having to alter any of the settings with the exception of the `_HOSTNAME` vars. You can also change the majority of these settings from within the Manager. There are instances where these variables would want to be set if you are running multiple handlers or need to enforce a Global Setting for one specific installation.

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `PORTAL_CACHE_TYPE`       | Only Cache Type available for now -                                                  | `FILE`                                     |
| `PORTAL_TEMPLATE_DIR`     |                                                                                      | `/usr/share/loki-ng/portal/templates` |

| `PORTAL_ENABLE_REST`      | Allow REST access to the Portal -                                                    | `FALSE`                                    |
| `PORTAL_REST_ALLOWED_IPs` | If above options enabled, provide comma seperated list of IP/Network to allow access | `0.0.0.0/0`                                |
| `ENABLE_IMPERSONATION`    | If you wish to allow impersonation using a seperate theme set to `TRUE`              | `FALSE`                                    |
| `IMPERSONATE_HOSTNAME`    | Hostname to use to load the custom impersonation theme                               |                                            |

- With impersonation, if you enable it, it will add a new field to your login screen, which may not be what you want if this is a production system. You will need to create two custom themes (one as a replica of bootstrap, and one for impersonation). In the custom theme, make modifications to `login.tpl` to stop it from loading impersonation.tpl, yet in your impersonation theme, leave it in there. Then, when one of your admin/support team visits the custom `IMPERSONATE_HOSTNAME` you have defined it will load the full theme with allows to impersonate, where as the default theme will not show this.
